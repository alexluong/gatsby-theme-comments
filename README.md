You want to drive engagement for your Gatsby blog via comments.

## Installation

```
npm install gatsby-theme-comments gatsby-plugin-firebase
npm install -D dotenv
```

## Usage

### 1. Register plugins

In `gatsby-config.js`:

```js
require("dotenv").config()

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    ...otherPlugins,

    "gatsby-plugin-firebase",
    "gatsby-theme-comments",
  ],
}
```

### 2. Set up Firestore and environment variables

- Create a Firebase project
- Create a new Firestore database
- Inside the `Database` page, open the `Indexes` tab and add a composite index like so:

![Firestore index instruction](https://github.com/alexluong/gatsby-theme-comments/tree/master/firestore-index.png)

- Create a `.env` in your root directory:

```
GATSBY_FIREBASE_API_KEY=<YOUR_FIREBASE_API_KEY>
GATSBY_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=<YOUR_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN>
GATSBY_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL=<YOUR_FIREBASE_DATABASE_URL>
GATSBY_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=<YOUR_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID>
GATSBY_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=<YOUR_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET>
GATSBY_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=<YOUR_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID>
GATSBY_FIREBASE_APP_ID=<YOUR_FIREBASE_APP_ID>
```

### 3. Use in React

In your post template (`src/templates/post.js`), you can use `CommentSection` in your JSX:

```jsx
import { CommentSection } from "gatsby-theme-comments"

...

return (
  <Layout>
    <Article />
    <Author />

    <CommentSection id={slug} />
  </Layout>
)
```

The `id` prop must be a unique string or number that identifies the post. It can be the post's id, slug, or title, but do be aware that you'd lose track of the comments if you change that id.

For example, let's say that you use `slug` as the identifier. If you want to change the post's slug, remember to go into your Firebase database and change that value too.

## APIs

### Comment

The `Comment` interface is an object that looks like this:

```ts
interface Comment {
  id: string;
  content: string;
  name: string;
  createdAt: Timestamp;
  updatedAt: Timestamp;
}

interface Timestamp {
  nanoseconds: number;
  milliseconds: number;
  toDate: function;
}
```

### Exports

#### CommentSection

A component that renders a form for users to add comment as well as all the comments of the post. This is the simplest way to use `gatsby-theme-comments`. You can use this component in your `Post` template.

##### id

> `string` | *required*

A unique identifier used to identify each post. It cannot contain special characters such as "/".

#### CommentCount

A component that renders the comment count of the post

##### id

> `string` | *required*

A unique identifier used to identify each post

#### useComments

> `function(id: string): { loading: boolean, error: Error, comments: Array<Comment> }`

This hook takes the identifier as argument and gives you the corresponding array of comments.

If the identifier is invalid, the comment array is empty.

```jsx
function Comments({ id }) {
  const { loading, comments } = useComments()

  if (loading) {
    return <p>Loading...</p>
  }

  return (
    <ul>
      {comments.map(comment) => (
        <li key={comment.id}>{comment.content}</li>
      )}
    </ul>
  )
}
```

#### useCommentCount

> `function(id: string): { loading: boolean, error: Error, commentCount: number }`

This hook takes the identifier as argument and gives you the corresponding number of comments.

If the identifier is invalid, the count is 0. The reason for this is that the plugin only keeps track of posts with at least 1 comment. Therefore, if a post doesn't have any, its `id` would not be available in database.

```jsx
function CommentCount({ id }) {
  const { loading, commentCount } = useCommentCount()

  if (loading) {
    return <p>0 comment</p>
  }

  return <p>{commentCount} comment{commentCount > 1 ? "s" : ""}</p>
}
```

#### useAddComment

> `function(): { loading: boolean, error: Error, addComment: function(comment: Comment): void }`

This hook returns a function for you to add comment to database.

```jsx
function AddComment({ comment }) {
  const { addComment } = useAddComment()

  return (
    <button onClick={() => addComment(comment)}>Add</button>
  )
}
```

*Note*: The `Comment` you pass to the `addComment` function is one without `Timestamp`. The `createdAt` field will be included whenever the plugin makes a call to Firebase. You don't have to construct that value.

### Shadowable Components

Here is a list of recommended components that you can shadow:

- `components/Button.js`
- `components/Comment.js`
- `components/CommentCount.js`
- `components/Comments.js`
- `components/Form.js`
- `components/Loading.js`
- `components/TextField.js`

## Demo

To run the demo,

- Clone this project
- `cd` into `examples/demo`
- Add your Firebase details to `.env`
- Create an index in Firestore as shown in the second section
- Run `npm start`
- Try out the project on `localhost:8000`

**Note**: Depending on how you've set up your Firestore project, you may have to change the permissions first. A good starting point would be:

```js
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if true;
    }
  }
}
```

Just don't use it in production.
